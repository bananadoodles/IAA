### FIX MISSING VALUES
#### For any variable with missing values, change the data to include a missing category 
#### instead of a missing value for the categorical variable.  
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#read in libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(car)

#read in training data
insurance_t_binned<-read_csv("C:\\Users\\eebla\\OneDrive\\Documents\\IAA\\AA502-Fall_I\\Homework\\LogisticRegHW\\HW2\\insurance_t_bin.csv")

#read in validation data
insurance_v_binned<-read_csv("C:\\Users\\eebla\\OneDrive\\Documents\\IAA\\AA502-Fall_I\\Homework\\LogisticRegHW\\HW2\\insurance_v_bin.csv")

#make all columns characters so all NAs can be put as Missing
insurance_t_binned<-insurance_t_binned %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), as.character))

#make all nas "missing' 
#insurance_t_binned[is.na(insurance_t_binned)] = '00 Miss' 

#check to make sure there are no more NAS, looks good

str(insurance_t_binned_to_model)
```

### SEPARATION CONCERNS
#### Check each variable for separation concerns. Document in the report and adjust any 
#### variables with complete or quasi-separation concerns. 
```{r, separation concerns}

target_freq_df=setNames(data.frame(matrix(ncol = 4, nrow = 0)), c("var_name","INS","level","Freq"))

### GET RID OF MULTICOLLINEARITY DO NOT NEED THIS SECTION ANYMORE
```{r, include=FALSE}
#get rid of redundant variables that are causing problems
#insurance_t_binned_to_model<-insurance_t_binned_to_model%>%
#  select(-c("CC","INV"))

#use VIF
#vif(full.model_after_alias)
```
### MAIN EFFECTS MODEL
#### Build a main effects only binary logistic regression model to predict the purchase of the 
#### insurance product. 
#### Use backward selection to do the variable selection ‚Äì the Bank currently uses ùõº = 0.002 
#### and p-values to perform backward, but is open to another technique and/or significance 
#### level if documented in your report. 
#### Report the final variables from this model ranked by p-value. 
```{r, main effects model}
#MAIN EFFECTS MODEL AKA NO INTERACTIONS

#set up full and empty models to do stepwise
full.model_ins <- glm(INS ~ ., data = insurance_t_binned_to_model, family = binomial(link = "logit"))

### INTERPRET COEFF AKA ODDS RATIO
#### Interpret one variable‚Äôs odds ratio from your final model as an example. 
#### Report on any interesting findings from your odds ratios from your model.
```{r,coeff interpretation}

#df with coeffs from p backwards model

### LOOK FOR INTERACTIONS
#### Investigate possible interactions using forward selection including only the main effects from 
#### your previous final model. 
#### Report the final interaction variables from this model ranked by p-value.

### FINAL LOGISTIC MODEL
#### Report your final logistic regression model‚Äôs variables by significance.
